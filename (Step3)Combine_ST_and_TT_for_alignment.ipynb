Striking schoolchildren in 2019 carry banners reading  \" You\\'ll die of old age , I\\'ll die of climate change .\"',\n",
       " 'The environmental problems addressed by Cullis-Suzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s , when deforestation , the depletion of the ozone layer , and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour . Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years . Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban , ozone depletion has slowed dramatically , and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined .',\n",

       " 'In 2016 , Matthew de Grood , the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary , was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions .',\n",
       " \"Now , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as unsupervised outings . The decision won't come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea . There are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .\",\n",
       " 'First , let\\'s examine the more pessimistic side . De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break . It was a violent and unpredictable attack . He suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication . His psychiatrist , Dr . Santoch Rai , has said in front of the review board that  \" if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence , it would be severe .\" Despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-offense . But is this reason enough to remain afraid ? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up ?',\n",
       " \"As long as de Grood continues to take his medication , there isn't a huge risk of reoffense , so why are people so concerned ? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with schizophrenia , largely influences this fear . Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . But others , including schizophrenia , remain highly stigmatized . This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people .\",\n",
       " \"That was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . In fact , the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . In light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood .\",\n",
       " \"I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently . A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well . Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation . It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people , those with schizophrenia in particular , cannot ever mesh with society ; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals . He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law , so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better ?\",\n",

Santoch Rai , has said in front of the review board that  \" if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence , it would be severe .\" Despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-offense .

       " \"As long as de Grood continues to take his medication , there isn't a huge risk of reoffense , so why are people so concerned ? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with schizophrenia , largely influences this fear . Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . But others , including schizophrenia , remain highly stigmatized . This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people . ||| 只要 德 格罗 德 继续 服药 ， 就 不会 有 再次 犯罪 的 巨大 风险 ， 那么 人们 为什么 会 如此 担心 呢 ？ 我 认为 ， 围绕 精神疾病 患者 ， 特别 是 精神分裂症 患者 的 耻辱感 ， 在 很大 程度 上 影响 了 这种 恐惧 。 某些 精神疾病 的 耻辱感 有所 减弱 ， 如 情绪 和 焦虑症 。 但 其他 疾病 ， 包括 精神分裂症 ， 仍然 受到 高度 的 耻辱感 。 这 在 很大 程度 上 是因为 许多 人 将 精神分裂症 患者 描绘成 危险 的 人 ， 他们 的 脑袋 里 有 声音 告诉 他们 要 杀人 。 \\n\",\n",
       " \"That was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . In fact , the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . In light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood . ||| 事实上 ， 大多数 精神分裂症 患者 都 是 非暴力 的 ， 他们 更 有 可能 是 受害者 ， 而 不是 犯罪 或 暴力 的 实施者 。 有鉴于此 ， 在 对 再次 犯罪 的 恐惧 更 多 是 基于 对 精神分裂症 患者 的 偏见 而 不是 实际 可能性 的 情况 下 ， 坚持 剥夺 德 格罗 德 的 某些 自由 似乎 是 不合理 的 。 \\n\",\n",

It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people , those with schizophrenia in particular , cannot ever mesh with society ; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals .

       " 'First , let\\'s examine the more pessimistic side . De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break . It was a violent and unpredictable attack . He suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication . His psychiatrist , Dr . Santoch Rai , has said in front of the review board that  \" if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence , it would be severe .\" Despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-offense .

Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up ? |||  首先 ， 让 我们 看看 较为 悲观 的 一面 。 德 · 格罗 德 确实 在 精神病 发作 期间 捅 死 了   5   个人 。 这是 一次 不可 预测 的 暴力 袭击 。 他 患有 精神分裂症 ， 这 就是 为什么 他 被 裁定 不负 刑事责任 ， 但 此后 一直 在 看 精神病 医生 和 服用 药物 。 他 的 精神科 医生 桑 托克 · 雷曾 在 审查 委员会 面前 表示 ， “ 如果 马修 · 德 · 格罗 德 再次 犯法 ， 那 将 后果严重 。 ”   尽管 他 感觉 有 进步 ， 但 仍 有 再次 攻击 他人 的 风险 。 但 这个 理由 足以 令人 继续 害怕 吗 ？ 这个 理由 足够 把 德 格罗 德关 起来 吗 ？ \\n',\n",
       " \"As long as de Grood continues to take his medication , there isn't a huge risk of reoffense , so why are people so concerned ? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with schizophrenia , largely influences this fear . Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . But others , including schizophrenia , remain highly stigmatized . This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people . |||  只要 德 · 格罗 德 继续 服药 ， 再 犯罪 的 风险 就 不会 很大 ， 那么 人们 为什么 这么 担心 呢 ？ 我 认为 ， 人们 对 精神病 患者 ， 特别 是 精神分裂症 患者 的 污名 ， 很大 程度 上 导致 了 这种 恐惧 。 某些 精神疾病 已经 变得 不 那么 可怕 了 ， 比如 情绪 和 焦虑 障碍 。 但 其他 疾病 ， 包括 精神分裂症 ， 仍然 被 高度 污名 化 。 这 在 很大 程度 上 是因为 许多 人 把 精神分裂症 患者 描绘成 危险 人物 ， 他们 的 脑袋 里 有 声音 告诉 他们 要 杀人 。 \\n\",\n",
       " \"That was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . In fact , the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . In light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood . |||  这种 情况 确实 有 发生 ， 但 这种 情况 很少 见 ， 这 也许 就是 为什么 我们 这种 事情 记忆 深刻 。 事实上 ， 大多数 精神分裂症 患者 是 非暴力 的 ， 他们 更 可能 是 犯罪 或 暴力 的 受害者 ， 而 不是 实施者 。 有鉴于此 ， 若 对 再次 犯罪 的 恐惧 更多地 基于 对 精神分裂症 患者 的 偏见 态度 而 不是 实际 可能性 ， 坚持 剥夺 德 格罗 德 某些 自由 似乎 是 不合理 的 。 \\n\",\n",

Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation . It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people , those with schizophrenia in particular , cannot ever mesh with society ; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals . He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law , so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better ? |||  我 不 认为 德 格罗 德 应该 永远 无人 监管 。 通过 一个 类似 假释 制度 进行 监管 ， 以 确保 他 仍然 在 服用 他 的 药物 且 药物 有效 。 他 辩称 ， 除非 绝对 必要 ， 否则 他 或 其他 精神病 患者 仍 被 收容 是 一种 隔离 。 这会 使 精神病 患者 ， 特别 是 精神分裂症 患者 ， 永远 无法 融入 社会 ； 从而 他们 将 继续 被 污名 化 ， 且视 他们 为 危险 罪犯 的 观念 将 永久化 。 法庭 认定 他 不负 刑事责任 ， 为什么 要 把 他 当作 囚犯 对待 ， 而 不是 把 他 当作 一个 生病 了 、 现在 康复 了 的 人 ？ \\n\",\n",
