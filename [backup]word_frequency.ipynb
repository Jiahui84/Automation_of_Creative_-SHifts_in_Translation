Warren said on Twitter.\\nMy daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her, Michels said. \"We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion, and my daughter was all for that.\"\\nWhy viruses like Herpes and Zika will need to be reclassified: Biotech impact\\nNew research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be retooled, because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood. The findings could have significant impact on how they are classified, our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect hosts, and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them.\\nIn the 1950s and \\'60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses, they discovered the detailed structure of the capsid -- an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protects the virus\\' genetic material. The majority of viruses have capsids that are typically quasi-spherical and display icosahedral symmetry -- like a 20-sided dice for instance.\\nThe capsid shell is what protects them, and as scientists discovered their structure, they proposed that capsids could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome, and therefore could infect hosts differently.\\nWhy this matters\\nWhen designing drugs to target viruses, scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy.\\nThis was because despite having the structural images from cryo-electron microscopy, we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architectures of different viruses.\\nWe discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form icosahedral capsid shells, Luque said. \"So, many viruses don\\'t adopt only the two broadly understood capsid architectures. There are now at least eight ways in which their icosahedral capsids could be designed.\"\\nThey used a generalization of the quasiequivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an icosahedral capsid.\\nTheir study, which will be published in Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural lineage, based on the protein that they\\'re composed of, adopt consistent icosahedral capsid layouts, providing a new approach to study virus evolution.\\nBiotech applications\\nStructural biologists can now take this information and reclassify the structure of the viruses, which will help unveil molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.\\nIt will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nanotech and biotech applications, and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the capsid. This can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.\\nWe can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the capsid, to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infects the host cell, or break it apart after it\\'s formed, Luque said. \"This could facilitate the characterization and identification of antiviral targets for viruses sharing the same icosahedral layout.\"\\nArchitectural applications\\nThe geometries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction.\\nThis study introduces a more general framework than the classic Caspar-Klug construction. It is based on the conservation of the local vertices formed by the proteins that interact in the capsid, Luque explained. \"This approach led to the discovery of six new types of icosahedral capsid layouts, while recovering the two classical layouts from Caspar-Klug based on Goldberg and geodesic polyhedra.\"\\nPriest who sexually abused boys in Wisconsin gets 30 years\\nA former priest accused of sexually assaulting young boys in Wisconsin decades ago has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.\\nFour men testified Thursday about how the assaults affected their lives. One of the victims went public for the first time.\\nEricksen apologized to the victims in court and said he has come to realize the impact the assaults had on victims. At least 11 men claim they were abused by Ericksen during his time in the clergy.\\nEricksen was removed from the priesthood in 1988.\\nHaving Too Much Of This Spice Could Damage Liver\\nMay cause liver damage - Per studies, too much coumarin can also be responsible for liver toxicity and damage. This is according to several studies made on the effects of too much coumarin in our bodies.\\nMay cause mouth sores - Not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores. This is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a compound that when ingested in large amounts, can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies. However, one can only get mouth sores from cinnamaldehyde when they\\'re allergic from it.\\nMay cause breathing problems - This is more of a general precaution since cinnamon\\'s fine texture makes it very easy to inhale that may cause coughing and gagging as well as the cinnamaldehyde in it acting as a throat irritant.\\nMay cause low blood sugar - For many people, cinnamon is helpful since it\\'s well known for having the ability to lower our blood sugar. This is good, especially for those who suffer from high blood sugar. However, too many of it can make our blood sugar fall too low, posing a new set of health risks.\\nA federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee\\'s 48-hour waiting period law for abortions.\\nExperts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain, and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision. But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions. The experts also disagreed on whether Tennessee\\'s 48-hour waiting period would make any difference for those women.\\nOn Thursday, attorneys for the state introduced a study from Utah on the effects of a 72-hour waiting period there. It found that 8% of participating women who attended an initial counselling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion.\\nBiggs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems. She said a national study comparing women seeking abortions who were just under the cutoff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cutoff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post-traumatic stress.\\nColeman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically biased in favor of abortions.\\nFrench authorities and Normandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul stench continues to spread over a swath of territory.\\nNo one was injured in Thursday\\'s fire at a lubricant plant in Rouen, but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River.\\nThe head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extinguished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours. Firefighters are still on the scene.\\nThe administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out, saying it could spread to neighboring regions.\\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. The plant is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.\\nUnsurprisingly, the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in Asia, with China still expected to overtake Japan as the world\\'s top importer of LNG.\\nMeanwhile, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its number-one spot in the global LNG export race.

Suicides among members of the Reserves and the National Guard also grew.\\nThe number of suicides across the military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the most at-risk population is young enlisted men, and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method. Army suicides went from 114 to 139, while the Marines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68. The Air Force dipped from 63 to 60.\\nMilitary and defense leaders expressed dismay and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force, train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it. Van Winkle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication. She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms, but that some states or bases have their own restrictions.\\nThey also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help, because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clearances. And military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived roadblocks.\\nThis year for the first time, the Pentagon included statistics for suicides by military spouses and dependents. Van Winkle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017, but officials are working to get better at collecting family data.\\nAccording to the report, there were 186 families that had suicides - 123 were spouses and 63 were dependents between the ages of 12 and 23.\\nThe vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40, while 70 percent of the dependent suicides were males. About half of the dependents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and, for those younger than that, most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17.\\nThe campaign also incurred a one-time late fee over its failure to pay on time.\\nGordon told police she didn\\'t remember being shot, but did remember an argument with Cain during which her car window shattered and she passed out.

But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.\\nThe star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system\\'s largest planet.\\nThe planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.\\nRed dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.\\nThere is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.\\nPlanets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit. Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the \"core accretion\" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.\\nIn this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold, Morales said. \"This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear. These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet.\"\\nSchool strikers around the world march to demand action on climate\\nChildren around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday, in their first major action since the issue topped world leader\\'s agenda at the United Nations this week.\\nSome of the first protests began in New Zealand, where Thunberg saidorganizers estimated 170,000 people marched across the country.

Striking schoolchildren in 2019 carry banners reading  \" You\\'ll die of old age , I\\'ll die of climate change .\"\\nThe environmental problems addressed by Cullis-Suzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s , when deforestation , the depletion of the ozone layer , and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour . Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years . Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban , ozone depletion has slowed dramatically , and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined .\\nSo what does the future have in store for Thunberg ? Well that depends how you look at Cullis-Suzuki\\'s example . On one hand , none of her worst fears came to pass . On the other , world governments still have ecological problems to contend with , and are still being lectured by children about them .\\nAssuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Thunberg says it won\\'t unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and NGO career that kicked off with one famous speech .\\nBy then , another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the Martian colonies .\\nMr Corbyn called on rebel Tories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance , particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson .\\nUnder the proposals , opposition parties would seek to oust Boris Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on 31 October .\\nThe plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time , but senior figures in the SNP are concerned that Mr Johnson could defy a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October .\\nNicola Sturgeon , the SNP leader , suggested that Mr Corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a  \" terrible idea .\"\\nResponding to a tweet suggesting installing the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister , she said : \" Agree with this .\\n Vote of no confidence , opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension , and then immediate general election .\\nVeteran MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SNP source insisted it had to be the Labour leader .\\nTrying to find a compromise candidate , a national unity candidate , is too complicated , especially in the time we have .

It is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy , raucous trip .\\nThree students were formally disciplined by the university , which launched its own investigation into the football team\\'s conduct .\\nOne student was expelled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment , and one count of aggressive behaviour .\\nMeanwhile two other students , who were also accused of harassment , were issued with final warnings and made to issue apologies .\\nOne was banned from University premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events . All three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies .\\nThe Surrey University men\\'s football club said that they  \" sincerely apologise \" for its members actions during the Croatia tour .\\nNow , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as unsupervised outings . The decision won\\'t come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we\\'re left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea . There are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .\\nFirst , let\\'s examine the more pessimistic side . De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break . It was a violent and unpredictable attack . He suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication . His psychiatrist , Dr . Santoch Rai , has said in front of the review board that  \" if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence , it would be severe .\" Despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-offense . But is this reason enough to remain afraid ? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up ?\\nAs long as de Grood continues to take his medication , there isn\\'t a huge risk of reoffense , so why are people so concerned ? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with schizophrenia , largely influences this fear . Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . But others , including schizophrenia , remain highly stigmatized . This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people .\\nThat was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that\\'s perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . In fact , the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . In light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood .\\nI am convinced that  [ Trocsanyi ] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the European Commission , Orban said . \" His sin was that he helped the government and me ... to protect Hungary from migration .\"\\nThe move is seen as an embarrassment for Orban , who proposed Trocsanyi , and who has been in constant conflict with Brussels over his migration policy and other issues .\\nBabies on a plane : Japan Airlines unveils tool to tackle horror of screaming infants\\nWhen passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat , a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan , alerting other passengers who have yet to select their seats .\\nJAL was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of earshot of a screaming infant .\\nJAL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticipating seat reservations by serial snorers and passengers who fully recline their seats during in-flight meals .\\nBut the move attracted praise from some social media users .\\nThey are babies , as we all once were .

S ., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .\\n This is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , Pompeo said .\\nHe added that the U . S . would provide an additional $4 . 5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use .\\n He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all .\\nTesla jumps on report Musk aims to deliver 100 , 000 cars this quarter\\nShares of Tesla jumped more than 5 % after Electrek , an electric vehicle news website , reported that CEO Elon Musk said the company  \" has a shot \" at delivering 100 , 000 cars this quarter , which would be a new record .\\nThe CEO also reportedly added , \" The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries .\"\\nThe automaker is expected to report its quarterly vehicle deliveries in the next few days .\\nLast quarter , Tesla delivered approximately 95 , 000 electric vehicles .\\nGreece : 5 deny poor women\\'s babies sold in illegal adoptions\\nFive Greek and Georgian citizens have appeared in court on charges of belonging to a criminal organization that allegedly sold babies for adoption .\\nAll five denied the charges before a Thessaloniki magistrate on Friday . The two Georgian nationals are accused of being the ringleaders .\\nThe gang allegedly recruited pregnant Bulgarian women who were destitute and willing to give up newborns they might deliver . Authorities say the group sold babies to childless Greek couples .\\nA total 12 people were arrested this week in connection with the alleged illegal adoptions and the alleged sale of human eggs . Another 54 have been charged with complicity .\\n The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities , some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , Mr Pompeo told a news conference in New York , where he has been attending the United Nations General Assembly .\\n Today I am announcing that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon on May 19 , Mr Pompeo added .\\nFather Remains Hopeful That Suspect Who Fatally Shot Son One Year Ago Will Be Caught\\nIt\\'s been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot , but the victim\\'s family isn\\'t giving up hope that the shooter will be caught .\\nSomebody knows something , they need to say something , he said .\\nSecurity video , which has never been released , showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him . Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car . One of them walked up to the driver\\'s side , and shot Alford . The four people in Alford\\'s car jumped out and ran . The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away .\\nWherever this coward is , he will get caught , Alford said .\\nThis grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son , and he said he still didn\\'t know who was in the car with him when he was shot .\\nThey upped and ran out of my son\\'s car like that , where did you run to , Alford said . \" Did you go back and try to help him or what ? Nobody said nothing .\"\\nAlford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School , then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team . Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse .\\nAs the investigation into the fatal shooting continues , Alford said he wasn\\'t giving up either .\\n I can assure you , this one is going to get solved , he said .\\nAlford is personally offering a $2 , 000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction . Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police .\\nHumiliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awaits Johnson in Brussels if he tries to weasel out of his commitments to request an extension . That will comfort European officials , who would most probably agree to it . Mainly because taking more time to find a solution reduces the threat of a no-deal Brexit , which would be economically harmful to both sides .\\nJohnson\\'s regular bashing of his predecessor\\'s  \" backstop \" proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland and protect the EU single market hasn\\'t led to any convincing alternatives . Officials say the proposals sent in by the UK on alternative arrangements aren\\'t concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an October 31 exit .\\nIn an ideal world , a series of blows landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end . Europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the UK , given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this drags on . If there\\'s a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament , the EU should grab it .\\nBut this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home .\\nThe EU is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them ; it\\'s less good at unilaterally imposing its will . The UK is hemmed in by its own internal contradictions , at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the impasse .\\nBrexit can get plenty more toxic from here .\\nBlack hole swallowing and ripping apart star captured for first time\\nA gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ripping apart a star for the first time .\\nIt was then sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event .\\nAstronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at TESS , whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets , caught the beginning of the violent event .\\nStars get sucked in when they venture too close to a supermassive black hole , which lives at the centre of most galaxies , including the Earth\\'s Milky Way .\\nThe black hole\\'s impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart , with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole , forming a disc of hot , bright gas as it is swallowed .\\nUK business committee to probe Thomas Cook collapse\\nThe aviation regulator said it has brought back over 40 % of the total number of passengers in the largest peacetime repatriation \\'Operation Matterhorn\\' launched on Monday .\\nMeanwhile , the British parliament\\'s business committee has launched an inquiry into the collapse of Thomas Cook and will seek to question the management over issues such as executive pay and accounting practices .\\nThomas Cook , the world\\'s oldest tour operator , collapsed in the early hours of Monday , hitting hotel owners , tourist sites and resorts around the world .\\nEvidence hearings will begin in mid-to-late October .\\n Directors will welcome the opportunity to set the record straight and demonstrate that their conduct was always in the best interests of Thomas Cook\\'s customers , employees and stakeholders , a person familiar with the company told Reuters .\\nOn Thursday , The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whistle-blower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week . ( The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C . I . A . officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine .)\\nThe president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower , who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding . The president himself has called the whistle-blower\\'s account a  \" political hack job .\"\\nWe decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower - including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible .\\nChina Says It Didn\\'t Fight Any War Nor Invaded Foreign Land\\nChina on Friday said it has not provoked a  \" single war or conflict \" or  \" invaded a single square \" of foreign land , skirting any reference to the 1962 war with India .\\n China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation , stated an official white paper released , four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China  ( CPC ) on October 1 .\\n China safeguards world peace through real actions . Over the past 70 years , China has not provoked a single war or conflict , nor invaded a single square of foreign land , the paper titled  \" China and the World in the New Era \" said .\\nSo far , the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute .\\nIt was finally diplomatically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops .\\nChina also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979 . China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea . Vietnam , Malaysia , the Philippines , Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims .\\n China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries , and delineated the China-Vietnam maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf , the white paper said , noting that since reform and opening up in 1978 , the country has cut its armed forces  \" by over four million .\"\\nThe two-million strong Chinese military still remain the world\\'s largest .\\nProlonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India\\nIndia\\'s monsoon season has overrun by almost a month , with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot .\\nNormally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September , but the average rainfall this month has been 37 % above normal . If the situation continues for the remaining few days , it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades , according to experts in the India Meteorological Department .\\nHomes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon .\\nOther cities such as Kolkata , Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall . Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains .\\nThe monsoon was also late to arrive . Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought .\\nFor consumers , the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions , an essential ingredient in Indian food . Onions are selling at 80 rupees  ( about  £ 1 ) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai , as opposed to the normal 20 rupees  ( 23p ).\\nAssange filed a criminal complaint himself , in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the secrecy of his client-attorney privileges .\\nEl Pais said UC Global SL had failed to respond to requests for comment on the claims .\\nIn April , Assange was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador .\\nHe took refuge there in 2012 while on bail and facing extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations , saying he feared extradition to the US if he left over the activities of WikiLeaks .\\nThe US formally requested his extradition in June on 18 charges , including computer misuse and the unauthorised disclosure of national defence information .\\nHe is now in Belmarsh prison in London after being jailed for violating bail conditions imposed over the Swedish extradition request and was due to be released last week , but was remanded in custody pending a hearing of the US extradition case in London in February 2020 .\\nIn May , Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into an allegation of rape against Assange - an allegation he has always denied .\\nWhy we still need Gandhi\\nThe leaders of the world\\'s two largest democracies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 150th birthday we are currently celebrating .\\nAnd Modi\\'s government has created an uproar by instituting a national registry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of Assam to ostensibly catch noncitizens from neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh , a step that may end up disenfranchising and imprisoning almost 2 million people .\\nFederal Emergency Management Agency  ( FEMA ) Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor smiles as he testifies before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on FEMA\\'s FY2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington , U .

President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency  ( FEMA ), the White House said in a statement .\\nGaynor , FEMA\\'s deputy administrator , had been acting chief of the agency , which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires .\\nGaynor\\'s nomination to the post was expected . He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job .\\nMan set alight on doorstep \\'in targeted attack\\'\\nA man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack .\\nPolice have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man\\'s house at about 1am on Thursday .\\n We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible .\\n While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened , we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don\\'t believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time .\\n Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us .\\n We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime .\\nDemocrats are largely in agreement about the strategy , with Pelosi saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is  \" the focus of the moment .\"\\nBy keeping the impeachment inquiry focused , leaders hope to keep the caucus unified -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings . The Ukraine matter is also relatively clear-cut and easy to explain to the public , lawmakers say . They also argue the probe , spearheaded by the intelligence committee , will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a narrower scope .\\n I\\'m in a district where I\\'ve been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be disciplined , I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that , Craig said , adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee .\\n I would vote no right now because we haven\\'t seen all the facts , Cartwright said . \" We have to presume that people are innocent , don\\'t we , and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation , if if all that is true .\"\\nOnce lawmakers return , though , movement is likely to be quick .\\n The caucus is unified around the lawlessness and corruption pouring forth from the White House , and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country , the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night . \" We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public . And if we do our job right , it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country .\"\\nMore than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry , according to a CNN count . However , that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump . Even if the House could pass the vote , it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate , one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party .\\nTrump official says lawyers had Ukraine call transcript moved to secure system\\nA senior Trump administration official acknowledged Friday that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of President Trump\\'s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to a highly secure system .\\nOther details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known , beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call .\\nThe whistleblower complaint , which was declassified by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee , alleges that White House officials said they were  \" directed \" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept .\\nThe whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information . The whistleblower also said that , according to White House officials , it was  \" not the first time \" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information . The complaint alleged that the White House tried to  \" restrict access \" to records of the call .\\n In the days following the phone call , I learned from multiple U . S . officials that senior White House officials had intervened to   lock down \" all records of the phone call , especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced - as customary - by the White House Situation Room ,\" the whistleblower stated .\\nThe White House released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday . The memo , which does not reflect a  \" verbatim transcript \" but is based on  \" notes and recollections \" of those memorializing the call , shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens .\\n The other thing , there is a lot of talk about Biden\\'s son , that Biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great , he said . \" Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution , so if you can look into it ... sounds horrible to me .\"\\nBut the whistleblower\\'s complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign . The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint , though , that the concerns were based on second-hand information .\\nThe White House lawyers \" directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a  \" cover-up .\"\\n A cover-up ? Think about that for a moment , Sekulow said on  \" Fox  & Friends \" Friday . \" The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine ? It\\'s so secret and such a cover-up , here\\'s the documents . This is nonsense .\"\\nUkraine scandal : Pelosi says Barr \\'rogue\\' ; former U . S . officials back investigation\\nPelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he\\'d withheld military aid to Ukraine . The aid was ultimately granted , but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump\\'s asking Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden , who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years .\\nAlso Friday , nearly 300 former U . S . foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation . The coalition said Trump\\'s actions constitute a  \" profound national security concern .\"\\nWe applaud those members of Congress , including Speaker Pelosi , who have started us down that necessary path , the letter states . \" President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process . That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power .\\nIt would also represent an effort to subordinate America\\'s national interests -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the president\\'s personal political interest .\\nTrump has denied there was any impropriety with the phone call . Friday , he denounced the complainant and again said the call with Zelensky was a  \" perfect conversation \"\\nSounding more and more like the so-called whistle-blower isn\\'t a whistle-blower at all , he tweeted . \" In addition , all second-hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else , a leaker or spy , feeding it to him or her ?

An officer at the Hengyang police station said he could not comment on the case . Wang\\'s mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan  ( about $220 , 000 ).\\n Especially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coerced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation .\\nWang\\'s death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer Ji Sizun , who died in police custody in July , Uighur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim who died last year . Nobel laureate winner Liu Xiaobo who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-year-prison sentence and activist Cao Shunli died in 2014 , detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China .\\nWang , who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished , has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before .\\nIn 2018 after he held up the placard calling for Xi\\'s resignation , he wrote online of how police stormed into his home , ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop .\\n These idiots .

The government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watchdog agency that critics say is toothless and has no real investigative powers .\\nProtesters are also organizing  \" anti-totalitarianism \" rallies in Hong Kong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China\\'s tyranny .\\nTse appealed to protesters to stop hijacking peaceful protests , like what happened in previous rallies when some lobbed gasoline bombs , set off street fires and vandalized public utilities . Police have responded with tear gas , water cannons , and other measures , prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force .\\nThe Civil Human Rights Front is also planning another big march on Oct . 1 , sparking fears of a bloody showdown that could embarrass China\\'s ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing . The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors .\\nNestle tightens controls on coffee beans after weedkiller scare\\nThe world\\'s largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans .\\nNestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil , since these countries are among the world\\'s biggest coffee producers .\\n Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices , including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods , the Swiss company said .\\nDoes glyphosate cause cancer ?\\nStill , the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks . Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance , the EPA said in a statement in April .\\nBut that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer .\\nEarlier this year , a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup , used on their property for more than three decades , had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other .

That teen , Cassidy , was grazed in the head by a bullet and played dead .\\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case , but jurors will decide whether Haskell should receive a death sentence or life in prison .\\nThe sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks , the station reported .\\nCassidy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members . She appeared to be praying before the guilty verdict was read Thursday , according to KPRC .\\nHaskell was disguised as a FedEx delivery driver when he went to the Stay home , apparently looking for his ex-wife , who is Katie Stay\\'s sister .\\nHe forced his way inside and tied up Cassidy , officials said . When the rest of her family returned minutes later , Haskell tied them up and demanded to know the whereabouts of his ex-wife . They said they didn\\'t know , and they were each shot in the back of the head .\\nCassidy , who was wounded , played dead until Haskell left , and was able to identify him to police . She told officials he was planning to drive to her grandparents\\' home and kill them .

Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone .\\nThe first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday . Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness , with lives lost in eight states .\\nWhile most patients have reported a history of using products containing THC , the psychoactive compound in cannabis , the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only  \" heavy nicotine vaping .\"\\nThe First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monitorigin developments in the US and elsewhere  \" closely ,\" following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping .\\nShe pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in Europe .\\nOur approach has been a precautionary one , which is why in Scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in Europe to vapour products , she said .\\nThe European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful .\\nThe directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-liquids .\\nIn Scotland , we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations .\\nIn the coming months , we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products .\"\\nShe added : \" It is important to stress , and for all of us to remember , that those devices are relatively new and , therefore , their impact continues to be studied . We do not yet fully understand what that impact is , which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious .\\nThat is perhaps a reason why e-cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland .\\nWe remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm .\\nWhile we already have among the strictest regimes on those products , if the evidence shows that further action is needed ... we will not hesitate to take it .\\nCambodian court charges exiled politicians with rebellion\\nA Cambodian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with plotting armed rebellion for planning to return from self-imposed exile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests .\\nThe Phnom Penh Municipal Court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the Cambodia National Rescue Party to oust the government would also be risking a long prison term .\\nNov . 9 is Cambodia\\'s independence day , celebrating when it obtained its freedom from France in 1953 .\\nThe party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the July 2018 election , and its dissolution was widely seen as being politically motivated , with Hun Sen\\'s ruling Cambodian People\\'s Party fearful that it could lose power in the polls .\\nHun Sen\\'s government seems unnerved by the planned return of opposition politicians , though the effort appears to be a quixotic one , with Sam Rainsy calling on Cambodian workers in Thailand to accompany him home in massive numbers .\\nHowever , the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers .\\nSam Rainsy went into exile in late 2015 to avoid a two-year prison sentence on charges of criminal defamation .

of their architecture will need to be retooled, because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood. the findings could have significant impact on how they are classified, our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect hosts, and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them.\\nin the 1950s and \\'60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses, they discovered the detailed structure of the capsid -- an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protects the virus\\' genetic material. the majority of viruses have capsids that are typically quasi-spherical and display icosahedral symmetry -- like a 20-sided dice for instance.\\nthe capsid shell is what protects them, and as scientists discovered their structure, they proposed that capsids could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome, and therefore could infect hosts differently.\\nwhy this matters\\nwhen designing drugs to target viruses, scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy.\\nthis was because despite having the structural images from cryo-electron microscopy, we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architectures of different viruses.\\nwe discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form icosahedral capsid shells, luque said. \"so, many viruses don\\'t adopt only the two broadly understood capsid architectures. there are now at least eight ways in which their icosahedral capsids could be designed.\"\\nthey used a generalization of the quasiequivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an icosahedral capsid.\\ntheir study, which will be published in nature communications on friday, september 27, also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural lineage, based on the protein that they\\'re composed of, adopt consistent icosahedral capsid layouts, providing a new approach to study virus evolution.\\nbiotech applications\\nstructural biologists can now take this information and reclassify the structure of the viruses, which will help unveil molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.\\nit will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nanotech and biotech applications, and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the capsid. this can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.\\nwe can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the capsid, to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infects the host cell, or break it apart after it\\'s formed, luque said. \"this could facilitate the characterization and identification of antiviral targets for viruses sharing the same icosahedral layout.\"\\narchitectural applications\\nthe geometries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction.\\nthis study introduces a more general framework than the classic caspar-klug construction. it is based on the conservation of the local vertices formed by the proteins that interact in the capsid, luque explained. \"this approach led to the discovery of six new types of icosahedral capsid layouts, while recovering the two classical layouts from caspar-klug based on goldberg and geodesic polyhedra.\"\\npriest who sexually abused boys in wisconsin gets 30 years\\na former priest accused of sexually assaulting young boys in wisconsin decades ago has been

according to several studies made on the effects of too much coumarin in our bodies.\\nmay cause mouth sores - not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores. this is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a compound that when ingested in large amounts, can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies. however, one can only get mouth sores from cinnamaldehyde when they\\'re allergic from it.\\nmay cause breathing problems - this is more of a general precaution since cinnamon\\'s fine texture makes it very easy to inhale that may cause coughing and gagging as well as the cinnamaldehyde in it acting as a throat irritant.\\nmay cause low blood sugar - for many people, cinnamon is helpful since it\\'s well known

as the overall numbers, with only the air force showing a decrease, according to data released by the pentagon thursday. suicides among members of the reserves and the national guard also grew.\\nthe number of suicides across the military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. according to the pentagon, the most at-risk population is young enlisted men, and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method. army suicides went from 114 to 139, while the marines went from 43 to 58 and the navy went from 65 to 68. the air force dipped from 63 to 60.\\nmilitary and defense leaders expressed dismay and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force, train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it. van winkle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication. she said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms, but that some states or bases have their own restrictions.\\nthey also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help, because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clearances. and military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived roadblocks.\\nthis year for the first time, the pentagon included statistics for suicides by military spouses and dependents. van winkle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017, but officials are working to

- nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40, while 70 percent of the dependent suicides were males. about half of the dependents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and,

even the largest planets that orbit them. but in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on thursday.\\nthe star, called gj 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of jupiter, our solar system\\'s largest planet.\\nthe planet, which like jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the calar alto observatory in spain. it travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.\\nred dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures. gj 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than jupiter.\\nthere is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the jupiter-like planet, morales said.\\nplanets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit. under the leading model for planetary formation, called the \"core accretion\" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.\\nin this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold, morales said. \"this makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear. these clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet.\"\\nschool strikers around the world march to demand action on climate\\nchildren around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate

was committed to stopping a no-deal brexit and removing  \" this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible .\"\\nthe spokesperson said : \" it is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of boris johnson and his cronies , who are determined to find a way to get around the benn act , but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister , who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter , with an election held immediately afterwards .\\nwe remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal brexit and getting rid of boris johnson .\\nlabour argued that the plan was the  \" simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal .\"\\nhowever the liberal democrats believe a temporary government led by mr corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the house , as he would need the backing of ex-tory

lads holiday . it is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy , raucous trip .\\nthree students were formally disciplined by the university , which launched its own investigation into the football team\\'s conduct .\\none student was expelled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment , and one count of aggressive behaviour .\\nmeanwhile two other students , who were also accused of harassment , were issued with final warnings and made to issue apologies .\\none was banned from university premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events . all three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies .\\nthe surrey university men\\'s football club said that they  \" sincerely apologise \" for its members actions during the croatia tour .\\nnow , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as unsupervised outings . the decision won\\'t come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we\\'re left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea . there are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .\\nfirst , let\\'s examine the more pessimistic side . de grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break . it was a violent and unpredictable attack . he suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication . his psychiatrist , dr . santoch rai , has said in front of the review board that  \" if matthew de grood were to commit another offence , it would be severe .\" despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-offense . but is this reason enough to remain afraid ? is it enough to keep de grood locked up ?\\nas long as de grood continues to take his medication , there isn\\'t a huge risk of reoffense , so why are people so concerned ? i believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with schizophrenia , largely influences this fear . certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . but others , including schizophrenia , remain highly stigmatized . this is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people .\\nthat was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that\\'s perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . in fact , the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . in light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood .\\ni am convinced that  [ trocsanyi ] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the european commission , orban said . \" his sin was that he helped the government and me ...

defined as a crime of honour is left to the judges discretion meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardonedin balochs case her parents initially insisted their

daughter was all for thatwhy viruses like herpes and zika will need to be reclassified biotech impactnew research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be retooled because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood the findings could have significant impact on how they are classified our understanding of how they form evolve and infect hosts and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target themin the 1950s and 60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses they discovered the detailed structure of the capsid  an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein  which protects the virus genetic material the majority of viruses have capsids that are typically quasispherical and display icosahedral symmetry  like a 20sided dice for instancethe capsid shell is what protects them and as scientists discovered their structure they proposed that capsids could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome and therefore could infect hosts differentlywhy this matterswhen designing drugs to target viruses scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacythis was because despite having the structural images from cryoelectron microscopy we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architectures of different viruseswe discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form icosahedral capsid shells luque said so many viruses dont adopt only the two broadly understood capsid architectures there are now at least eight ways in which their icosahedral capsids could be designedthey used a generalization of the quasiequivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an icosahedral capsidtheir study which will be published in nature communications on friday september 27 also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural lineage based on the protein that theyre composed of adopt consistent icosahedral capsid layouts providing a new approach to study virus evolutionbiotech applicationsstructural biologists can now take this information and reclassify the structure of the viruses which will help unveil molecular and evolutionary relationships between different virusesit will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nanotech and biotech applications and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the capsid this can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccineswe can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the capsid to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infects the host cell or break it apart after its formed luque said this could facilitate the characterization and identification of antiviral targets for viruses sharing the same icosahedral layoutarchitectural applicationsthe geometries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and constructionthis study introduces a more general framework than the classic casparklug construction it is based on the

according to several studies made on the effects of too much coumarin in our bodiesmay cause mouth sores  not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores this is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde which is a compound that when ingested in large amounts can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies however one can only get mouth sores from cinnamaldehyde when theyre allergic from itmay cause breathing problems  this is more of a general precaution since cinnamons fine texture makes it very easy to inhale that may cause coughing and gagging as well as the cinnamaldehyde in it acting as a throat irritantmay cause low blood sugar  for many people cinnamon is helpful since its well known for having the ability to lower our blood sugar this is good especially for those who suffer from high blood sugar however too many of it can make our blood sugar fall too low posing a new set of health risksa federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over tennessees 48hour waiting period law for abortionsexperts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision but they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions the experts also disagreed on whether tennessees 48hour waiting period would make any difference for those womenon thursday attorneys for the state introduced a study from utah on the effects of a 72hour waiting period there it found that 8 of participating women who attended an initial counselling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortionbiggs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes

orbiting really little starstars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them but in this case the star and the planet are not much different in size the researchers said on thursdaythe star called gj 3512 is about 12 the size of our sun while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of jupiter our solar systems largest planetthe planet which like jupiter is composed mainly of gas was discovered using a telescope at the calar alto observatory in spain it travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 daysred dwarfs are small with relatively low surface temperatures gj 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet being only about 35 bigger than jupiterthere is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past explaining the elliptical orbit of the jupiterlike planet morales saidplanets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit under the leading model for planetary formation called the core accretion model an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gasin this case the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold morales said this makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear these clumps can grow until they

marked in accra on wednesday with a call on pet owners to vaccinate their dogs in order to safeguard the lives of the citizenry the programme which was held under the theme   rabies  vaccinate to eliminate  was organised by the food and agriculture organisation   fao  in collaboration with the ministry of agriculture veterinary service according to him  the zero by 30 global strategic plan   of the 500  000 people who died from rabies each year  40 per cent are children living in asia and africa  and called for holistic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rabies he underscored the need for the country to embark on fiveyear campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rabies a comprehensive roadmap for progressive elimination of rabies  he noted had been rolled out through the ghana rabies and prevention action plan   20182030  to end epidemics of neglected tropical diseases by 2030 mr hailegabriel pledged the readiness of the fao to collaborate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rabies in the country he explained that through the   zero human rabies deaths by 2030  strategy  countries were supported to develop and implement their national rabies elimination plans that embrace the one health concept and cross sectoral collaboration dr kaluwa noted that 99 per cent of zoonotic disease like rabies was transmitted from dogs to humans  adding that one health approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rabies was expedient  though rabies has no cure  the infection is vaccine preventable  hence its elimination is feasible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vaccinated  he stated dr baah said although rabies was fully preventable using appropriate sustainable control strategies  lack of funds and concerted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the endemic  it is imperative that the animal sector is adequately resourced to prevent transmission of rabies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease  he added thunbergs grim pronouncements have earned her savage criticism

significance and underpinning both girls  messages was a nihilistic fatalism   i am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone  i am afraid to breathe the air because i dont know what chemicals are in it  cullissuzuki said in 1992  striking schoolchildren in 2019 carry banners reading   youll die of old age  ill die of climate change the environmental problems addressed by cullissuzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s  when deforestation  the depletion of the ozone layer  and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour  yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years  thanks to a landmark chemicals ban  ozone depletion has slowed dramatically  and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of texas and alaska combined so what does the future have in store for thunberg  well that depends how you look at cullissuzukis example  on one hand  none of her worst fears came to pass  on the other  world governments still have ecological problems to contend with  and are still being lectured by children about them assuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now  as thunberg says it wont unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so  then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long un and ngo career that kicked off with one famous speech by then  another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the martian colonies mr corbyn called on rebel tories and opposition mps to back him to lead a temporary administration in august  but the move was met with resistance  particularly from the liberal democrat leader jo swinson under the proposals  opposition parties would seek to oust boris johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the uk crashing out of the eu on 31 october the plan failed to gain crossparty support at the time  but senior figures in the snp are concerned that mr johnson could defy a law forcing him to delay brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 october nicola sturgeon  the snp leader  suggested that mr corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving mr johnson in charge would be a   terrible idea responding to a tweet suggesting installing the labour leader or another temporary prime minister  she said   agree with this  vote of no confidence  opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension  and then immediate general election veteran mps harriet harman and ken clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior snp source insisted it had to be the labour leader trying to find a compromise candidate  a national unity candidate  is too complicated  especially in the time we have  whether people like it or not  the temporary prime minister has to be corbyn an snp spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a nodeal brexit and removing   this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible the spokesperson said   it is now possible  if the political will is there  that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of boris johnson and his cronies  who are determined to find a way to get around the benn act  but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister  who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter  with an election held immediately afterwards we remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a nodeal brexit and getting rid of boris johnson labour argued that the plan was the   simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal however the liberal democrats believe a temporary government led by mr corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the house  as he would need the backing of extory mps and defectors from his own party over 50

banned from university premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events  all three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies the surrey university mens football club said that they   sincerely apologise  for its members actions during the croatia tour now  in 2019  there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms  such as unsupervised outings  the decision wont come for a few more weeks  so in the meantime were left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea  there are two sides to this  one citing his violent behaviour in the past  calling to prevent it from happening again  and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation first  lets examine the more pessimistic side  de grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break  it was a violent and unpredictable attack  he suffers from schizophrenia  which is why he was found not criminally responsible  but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication  his psychiatrist  dr  santoch rai  has said in front of the review board that   if matthew de grood were to commit another offence  it would be severe  despite his perceived improvement  there is still risk of reoffense  but is this reason enough to remain afraid  is it enough to keep de grood locked up as long as de grood continues to take his medication  there isnt a huge risk of reoffense  so why are people so concerned  i believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness  particularly those with schizophrenia  largely influences this fear  certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized  such as mood and anxiety disorders  but others  including schizophrenia  remain highly stigmatized  this is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people that was the case in this situation  but these instances are rare  and thats perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur  in fact  the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent  and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence  in light of this  it seems unreasonable to insist that de grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of reoffense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood i am convinced that   trocsanyi  is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the european commission  orban said   his sin was that he helped

syrian president bashar assads government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in idlib province on may 19  the assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity  pompeo told a news conference u  s  officials in may said theyd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time in april 2018  the u  s  britain and france launched airstrikes in syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month  this is different in some sense because it was chlorine  but know that president trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons  pompeo said he added that the u  s  would provide an additional 4  5 million to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected syrian chemicalweapons use  he is just one of a number of american citizens held in syria and we call upon the syrian regime to release them all tesla jumps on report musk aims to deliver

innumerable atrocities  some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity  mr pompeo told a news conference in new york  where he has been attending the united nations general assembly  today i am announcing that the united states has concluded that the assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon on may 19  mr pompeo added father remains hopeful that suspect who fatally shot son one year ago will be caughtits been one year since a 20yearold from long beach was fatally shot  but the victims family isnt giving up hope that the shooter will be caught somebody knows something  they need to say something  he said security video  which has never been released  showed alford stopped in the drivethru when a second car pulled up behind him  three suspects were then seen getting out of that car  one of them walked up to the drivers side  and shot alford  the four people in alfords car jumped out and ran  the suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away wherever this coward is  he will get caught  alford said this grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son  and he said he still didnt know who was in the car with him when he was shot they upped and ran out of my sons car like that  where did you run to  alford said   did you go back and try to help him or what  nobody said nothing alford said his son was a star football player at alemany high school  then a standout safety on the long beach city college football team  alford said his son was working toward playing for a division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse as the investigation into the fatal shooting continues  alford said he wasnt giving up either  i can assure you  this one is going to get solved  he said alford is personally offering a 2  000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction  anyone with information about this crime is urged to call long beach police humiliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awaits johnson in brussels if he tries to weasel out of his commitments to request an extension  that will comfort european officials  who would most probably agree to it  mainly because

enough to be considered operational in time for an october 31 exit in an ideal world  a series of blows landing on johnson  who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over brexit  would bring the match closer to an end  europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the uk  given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states  which is going to get harder the longer this drags on  if theres a window to try yet again to put a deal before the uk parliament  the eu should grab it but this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home the eu is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them  its less good at unilaterally imposing its will  the uk is hemmed in by its own internal contradictions  at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the

presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding  the president himself has called the whistleblowers account a   political hack job we decided to publish limited information about the whistleblower  including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the white house  because

attack police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the mans house at about 1am on thursday  we are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible  while we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened  we do believe that the incident was targeted and i would like to stress that i dont believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time  someone out there knows who has done this and i would urge them to come forward and speak to us  we need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy  with pelosi saying during her press conference on thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is   the focus of the moment by keeping the impeachment inquiry focused  leaders hope to keep the caucus unified  with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings  the ukraine matter is also relatively clearcut and easy to explain to the public  lawmakers say  they also argue the probe  spearheaded by the intelligence committee  will be able to move faster  possibly in the next month or two  with a narrower scope  im in a district where ive been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where i want to be disciplined  i want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts  and this process will allow us to do that  craig said  adding she backed a narrow probe led by the house intelligence committee  i would vote no right now because we havent seen all the facts  cartwright said   we have to presume that people are innocent  dont we  and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation  if if all that is true once lawmakers return  though  movement is likely to be quick  the caucus is unified around the lawlessness and corruption pouring forth from the white house  and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country  the maryland democrat told reporters on thursday night   we need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public  and if we do our job right  it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country more than half the members of the us house of representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry  according to a cnn count  however  that count includes many democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach trump  even if the house could pass the vote  it likely would go nowhere in the republicancontrolled senate  one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party trump official says lawyers had ukraine call transcript moved to secure systema senior trump administration official acknowledged friday that white house lawyers directed moving the transcript of president trumps july phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to a highly secure system other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known  beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call the whistleblower complaint  which was declassified by the trump administration and released to the public on thursday by the house intelligence committee  alleges that white house officials said they were   directed  by white house attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept the whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information  the whistleblower also said that  according to white house officials  it was   not the first time  a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national securitysensitive information  the complaint alleged that the white house tried to   restrict access  to records of the call  in the days following the phone call  i learned from multiple u  s  officials that senior white house officials had intervened to   lock down  all records of the phone call  especially the official wordforword transcript of the call that was produced  as customary  by the white house situation room  the whistleblower stated the white house released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on wednesday  the memo  which does not reflect a   verbatim transcript  but is based on   notes and recollections  of those memorializing the call  shows trump seeking assistance in investigating the bidens  the other thing  there is a lot of talk about bidens son  that biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great  he said   biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution  so if you can look into it  sounds horrible to me but the whistleblowers complaint alleges that trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign  the whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint  though  that the concerns were based on secondhand information the white house lawyers  directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top democrats as a   coverup  a coverup  think about that for a moment  sekulow said on   fox   friends  friday   the white house secured a call with the president of ukraine  its so secret and such a coverup  heres the documents  this is nonsense ukraine scandal  pelosi says barr rogue  former u  s  officials back investigationpelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after

investigate hunter biden  who worked for a ukrainian gas company for five years also friday  nearly 300 former u  s  foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation  the coalition said trumps actions constitute a   profound national security concern we applaud those members of congress  including speaker pelosi  who have started us down that necessary path  the letter states   president trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process  that would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power it would also represent an effort to subordinate americas national interests  and those of our closest allies and partners  to the presidents personal political interest trump has denied there was any impropriety with the phone call  friday  he denounced the complainant and again said the call with zelensky was a   perfect conversation sounding more and more like the socalled whistleblower isnt a whistleblower at all  he tweeted   in addition  all secondhand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not

advertising for ecigarettes and vaping products  is being considered by ministers the first minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in   the coming months it comes as it emerged a vapingrelated illness had claimed two more lives  bringing the total number of fatalities to 11 vaping  which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine  water  solvents and flavours  is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit  but its safety is still not entirely known but in the us  more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking ecigarettes  officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone the first deaths in florida and georgia were announced on tuesday and wednesday  currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness  with lives lost in eight states while most patients have reported a history of using products containing thc  the psychoactive compound in cannabis  the patient who died in georgia on wednesday reported only   heavy nicotine vaping the first minister has confirmed the scottish government was monitorigin developments in the us and elsewhere   closely  following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping she pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in europe our approach has been a precautionary one  which is why in scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in europe to vapour products  she said the european tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of ecigarettes and ensures that eliquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful the directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in eliquids in scotland  we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations in the coming months  we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products she added   it is important to stress  and for all of us to remember  that those devices are relatively new and  therefore  their impact continues to be studied  we do not yet fully understand what that impact is  which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious that is perhaps a reason why ecigarette use remains relatively low in scotland we remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm while we already have among the strictest regimes on those products  if the evidence shows that further action is needed  we will not hesitate to take it
